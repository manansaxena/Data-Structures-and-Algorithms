Arrays - 

-	An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in a contiguous memory locations.
-	Operations - 
		-	Creation, Insertion, Deletion and Updation
-	Char Array
		-	Each char has a size of one byte
		- 	A character array should always terminate with a null character - '\0'
-	Array to function as a reference
	-	If you print the size of array in main you would get the actual size but if you print it in function you will get 8 bytes as in a function it only passes the address of the first element of the array as a pointer
-	Linear Search (Brute Force Technique)
	-	Go to each index and check if it is equal to the key or not.
	-	Time Complexity : O(n)
-	Binary Search ()
	-	Works on sorted arrays
	-	Efficient searching algorithm
	-	Time Complexity : O(log n)
